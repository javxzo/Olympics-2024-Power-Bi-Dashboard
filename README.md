# 🏅 Olympics Dashboard Project

Another Power Bi project! This one was very fun and probably the cleanest out of them so far. It also took me a good amount of time to complete! This dashboard is for the 2024 Olympics with a Kaggle dataset - however, when this was being made, the Olympics were ongoing and the dataset being used was consistently being updated. The Python file, *app.py* covers that and makes this dashboard entirely updated! The rest of the details will be explained below!

Side note: I've attached images at the end in case you prefer not opening the .pbix file - our school accounts haven't permitted us to use Power Bi's upload service otherwise it would be up there, sorry!!

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies Used
- 📊 **Kaggle**: Source for continuously updated Olympic data.
- 🖥️ **Power BI**: Dashboard creation and data visualization.
- 📋 **Excel**: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
- 🐍 **Python** (Pandas, OS): Data wrangling and cleaning.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The dashboard is split into 4 interactive pages, each serving it's own purpose:

### 1. 🌟 Overview
This page highlights key statistics from the Olympics, such as:
- 🏅 **Medals by country**: Displays the distribution of gold, silver, and bronze medals.
- 👩‍🦰👨‍🦱 **Gender breakdown**: Insight into participation and performance by gender.
- 🏅 **Event type analysis**: Medal distribution across different sports.
- (and way more!)

### 2. 🏃‍♀️ Athletes
Explore detailed information about participating athletes and medalists. Key features include:
- 🔍 **Searchable athlete information**: Makes it easy to locate specific athletes.
- 🏅 **Medalist details**: A quick overview of athletes who won medals.

### 3. 🌍 Country Overview
Delve into the performance of top-performing countries, showcasing:
- 🥇 **Top countries by medals**: A snapshot of the countries with the highest medal counts.
- 📊 **Detailed country-level analysis**: Explore the number of medalists per country and trends in performance.

### 4. 📅 Historical
This page compares historical Olympic data with the current year's results, giving insight into:
- 📈 **Performance over time**: Track changes in the medal distribution across previous Olympic Games.
- 📊 **Comparison with past events**: Analyze how the current year's performance stacks up against historical trends.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is continually updated during the course of the Olympics, ensuring real-time data for accurate and relevant visualizations. It is sourced from **Kaggle** and processed using **Python (Pandas)** and **Excel**.

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
To explore the project, you will need:
1. 💻 **Power BI Desktop**: Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI to interact with the visualizations.
2. 🐍 **Python (optional)**: If you wish to modify or update the dataset manually using Python, ensure you have the required dependencies installed (`pandas`, `os`).
